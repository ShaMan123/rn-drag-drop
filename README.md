# rn-drag-drop
A low-level, highly customizable drag and drop framework, built with react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-reanimated


## Update
This library was created to provide a proper drag and drop mechanism for react-native.
Truth be told, it was quite good, the best I've come across at the time, but not good enough.
When starting this project I thought of a more robust solution - creating new gesture handlers (react-native-gesture-handler) that are as simple to use as PanGestureHandler. 
I was reluctant to tackle it but now I am excited to say I succeeded on android and iOS seems managable.

**This means there's no need for you to use this library, I will archive it in the near future**

**I suggest you try fiddling with the new gesture handlers: [PR#963](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/pull/963)**
